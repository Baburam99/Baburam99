I'm a passionate front-end developer from Nepal, currently 19 years old. My journey in web development has equipped me with skills in:

    HTML
    CSS
    JavaScript
    React
    Tailwind CSS

I'm currently diving deeper into back-end development with Express.js and MongoDB to become a full-stack developer.

I love building responsive and dynamic web applications, and I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges.
